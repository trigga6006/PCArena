// ─── Origin stories — where this rig came from ───

const ORIGINS = {
  APEX: [
    'Assembled in a climate-controlled datacenter by engineers who signed NDAs just to look at it. This is not a computer — it is an institution.',
    'Born from a requisition form that made accounting cry. Ninety-six cores, a terabyte of RAM, and a GPU that costs more than most cars.',
    'There was no budget. There was no limit. There was only the question: "What if we built everything at once?" This is the answer.',
  ],
  TITAN: [
    'Forged in a cleanroom where silicon meets divinity. Every component hand-picked, every benchmark shattered.',
    'Born from a build so excessive the power company called to ask questions. Overkill is a lifestyle.',
    'Assembled during a thunderstorm by an engineer who whispered "no compromises" with every screw.',
  ],
  HIVEMIND: [
    'Spawned from a workstation that rendered 4K frames while compiling the kernel. Multitasking is its mother tongue.',
    'Originally destined for a render farm, it developed consciousness somewhere around thread 47.',
    'Built by someone who thought "why have 8 cores when you can have all of them." The answer was power.',
  ],
  ARCMAGE: [
    'Channeled into existence through a GPU so powerful it bends light. Shaders are its spellbook.',
    'Its GPU was the last one in stock. The buyer drove 200 miles. That desperation became raw power.',
    'Emerged from a deep learning lab where neural networks dreamed in floating point. The math became magic.',
  ],
  BLITZ: [
    'Booted from an NVMe so fast the BIOS barely saw it. By the time you blink, it\'s already loaded.',
    'Optimized by someone who counted milliseconds the way poets count syllables. Speed is art.',
    'Its first POST was its fastest — zero bloat, zero waste, just raw velocity from power button to desktop.',
  ],
  FORTRESS: [
    'Packed with so much RAM the motherboard groaned. Nothing gets paged out. Nothing gets forgotten.',
    'Built to survive. While others crash under load, this rig opens another hundred tabs out of spite.',
    'Designed by someone whose worst nightmare was "insufficient memory." They made sure it would never happen.',
  ],
  BERSERKER: [
    'Overclocked on day one. The thermal paste was barely dry before the benchmarks started screaming.',
    'Its CPU runs so hot it could cook breakfast. But who needs breakfast when you have raw processing power.',
    'The product of someone who looked at the "safe" voltage limit and thought "that\'s a suggestion."',
  ],
  PHANTOM: [
    'Runs silent, hits hard. By the time the task manager notices, the work is already done.',
    'Built lean and mean — no RGB, no tempered glass, just a black box that processes at frightening speed.',
    'Its case has no windows because there\'s nothing to see. The real show is in the benchmarks.',
  ],
  NOMAD: [
    'Carried through airports and coffee shops, this road warrior computes anywhere the Wi-Fi reaches.',
    'Powered by battery and determination. Thermal throttling is just cardio for the CPU.',
    'It knows every power outlet in every terminal. Mobile, adaptable, and tougher than it looks.',
  ],
  SCRAPPER: [
    'Salvaged from parts that should\'ve been recycled. Held together by thermal paste and sheer will.',
    'Nobody expected it to boot. Nobody expected it to fight. And yet — here it is.',
    'Its specs say "budget." Its heart says "try me." What it lacks in power it makes up in grit.',
  ],
  SENTINEL: [
    'A balanced build by someone who reads reviews. Not flashy, not weak — just relentlessly dependable.',
    'Born in the sweet spot between budget and overkill. It does everything well and nothing poorly.',
    'The kind of rig that shows up, does the work, and never complains. Steady hands, steady framerates.',
